# Perceptron-and-Neural-Network-with-Python-from-scratch
This project masterfully creates a single perceptron and multi-layer neural network in Python from scratch instead of using the conventional Scikit learn packages

This project implements a single perceptron and a multi-layer neural network from scratch in Python using the famed Mnist dataset, bypassing traditional libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. 

It uses the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition, implementing key neural network components such as forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. 

The code is structured with separate classes for the perceptron and multi-layer neural network to ensure modularity and clarity. The project serves as a foundational resource for understanding how neural networks work under the hood.

### Features include:

Custom implementation of a perceptron for binary classification.

Multi-layer neural network with customizable hidden layers and activation functions.

Step-by-step explanation of the learning algorithm and weight updates.

This project is perfect for those wanting to understand the inner workings of neural networks!
